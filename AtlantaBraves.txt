This crew is quickly getting a ton of exposure to Aaron Nola. Everyone in the lineup but Acuña has seen Nola at least a bit; Freeman, Inciarte, and Markakis have each seen him a ton, with Freeman having the most success against him (although Markakis has taken him deep twice).

The Phillies will run out this lineup against Julio Teheran: 
Literally every position player on their roster has faced Teheran at least once; Hernandez and Herrera (plus the not-starting Maikel Franco) have 30-plus at-bats against him. Teheran will need to watch out against J.P. Crawford and Rhys Hoskins, each of whom have given him trouble in the past. Hernandez and Herrera have both already homered off of Teheran this season.

To date, the Phillies have played 24 games and have used 22 different batting orders (ignoring the change in starting pitcher). This is their first lineup with a Hernandez-Santana-Herrera-Hoskins-Altherr start with Kingery in the lineup. The Braves, meanwhile, have used only 11 lineups; tonight’s lineup is the same as yesterday’s victorious arrangement deployed against the Reds.

First pitch is at 7:05 pm ET.
