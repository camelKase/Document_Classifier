Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority investigators have scheduled meetings this weekend with members of its Fort Valley State University chapter as it continues its inquiry into sexual misconduct that is also under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
The sorority sent a letter dated Sunday, April 22, to the chapter outlining plans to investigate “unauthorized activities and misconduct involving current and former members.” The letter also says the chapter is disqualified from participating in various sorority activities, pending the outcome.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution obtained the letter Tuesday from the university under the Georgia Open Records Act.

The GBI said last week it is conducting a criminal investigation at Fort Valley State. The University System of Georgia, which oversees Fort Valley State, is also investigating. Publicly, officials and investigators have said little about the focus of the investigations. One university employee has been placed on administrative leave, as part of an inquiry into misconduct and hazing. The university is about 30 miles south of Macon.

The GBI last week took the unusual step of removing an agent from the case after University System of Georgia Chancellor Steve Wrigley complained the agent had mischaracterized to reporters how the investigation began.

The sorority issued a statement last week saying it was “appalled to learn of allegations of sexual misconduct against a Fort Valley State University employee who also is a graduate member of the sorority.”
